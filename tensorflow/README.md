# Sharpened Cosine Similarity
A layer implementation for TensorFlow

## Install
At your command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brohrer/sharpened_cosine_similarity_tensorflow.git
```
You'll need to install or upgrade TensorFlow if you haven't already.
If `python3` is the command you use to invoke Python at your command line:

```bash
python3 -m pip install tensorflow --upgrade
```

## Credit where it's due
The code here is based on and copy/pasted heavily from the initial TensorFlow
[implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lo-P_lMbw3t2RTwpzy1p8h0uKjkCx-RB)

## Background

The idea behind sharpened cosine similarity first surfaced as
[a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1232063619657093120)
in 2020. The most comprehensive history of the project and
list of other contributions is currently in
